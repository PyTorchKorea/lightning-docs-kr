The Lightning framework allows you to create customized, interactive UIs with the framework of your choice.

You can easily embed other tools and services (like a GitHub repo, a `FastAPI Service <https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/>`_, an `arXiv <https://arxiv.org/>`_ paper or a `Dask Cluster <https://docs.dask.org/en/stable/>`_ Admin page), or create a complete UI from scratch.


To get started, you can use built-in templates for the following frameworks:

* `React.js <https://github.com/Lightning-AI/lightning-template-react>`_
* `StreamLit <https://github.com/Lightning-AI/lightning-template-streamlit>`_

This section covers best practices to seamlessly make your Lightning code work both locally and in the cloud.
