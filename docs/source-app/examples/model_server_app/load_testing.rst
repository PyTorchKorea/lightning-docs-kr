***********************************
3. Build the Load Testing Component
***********************************

Now, we are going to create a component to test the performance of your model server.

We are going to use a python performance testing tool called `Locust <https://github.com/locustio/locust>`_.

.. literalinclude:: ./locust_component.py


Finally, once the component is done, we need to crate a ``locustfile.py`` file which defines the format of the request to send to your model server.

The endpoint to hit has the following format: ``/v2/models/{MODEL_NAME}/versions/{VERSION}/infer``.

.. literalinclude:: ./locustfile.py
