############
**Audience:** Users who want to show off their work.

***********************************
Option 1: Run on the cloud to share
***********************************
To share an app, simply run your app on the cloud:

.. code:: bash

    lightning run app app.py --cloud

Then share the link that's generated (`like this one <https://01g3p4bf3m61xsm2yzn0966q59.litng-ai-03.litng.ai/view/home>`_).

----

**********************************
Option 2: Expose a tunnel to share
**********************************
If you'd like to share yourself, feel free to run the app in local mode
and expose the URlapp.

Run local:

.. code:: bash

    lightning run app app.py

And then, use one of the many guides to `expose a tunnel <https://medium.com/botfuel/how-to-expose-a-local-development-server-to-the-internet-c31532d741cc>`_.
