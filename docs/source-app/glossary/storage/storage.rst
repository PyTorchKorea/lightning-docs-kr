**Audience:** Users who want to share files between components.


The Lightning Storage system makes it easy to share files between LightningWork so you can run your app both locally and in the cloud without changing the code.


Lightning storage provides two solutions :class:`~lightning.app.storage.drive.Drive` and :class:`~lightning.app.storage.path.Path` to deal with files locally and in the cloud likewise.
