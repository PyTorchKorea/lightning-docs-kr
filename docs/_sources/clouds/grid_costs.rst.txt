Lightning (via `lightning-grid <https://platform.grid.ai/#/dashboard>`_) provides access to cloud machines to the community for free. However, you must buy credits on `lightning-grid <https://platform.grid.ai/#/dashboard>`_ which are used to pay the cloud providers on your behalf.

If you want to run on your own AWS account and pay the cloud provider directly, please contact our onprem team: `<onprem@pytorchlightning.ai>`_
