###########################
Train on the cloud (expert)
###########################
**Audience**: Corporate or academic users who want to run on their Company or University private cloud account.

----

********************************
Run on your own cloud or cluster
********************************
If you have access to a corporate or academic cluster, you can simply submit jobs that run Lightning models and lightning will automatically work.
Please refer to :doc:`Clusters guide <cluster>` for more information.

***********************************
Run on your own cloud (hassle free)
***********************************
Cluster training can get complicated once you start doing multi-node training, fault-tolerant training or sweeps.
If you'd prefer to not deal with any of the hassles of running on your own cloud environments, lightning-grid enables University and Enterprise customers to run on the cloud with their own credentials or even onprem.

These are some of the benefits of running via lightning-grid:

- create datasets optimized for scale
- fully configurable on-prem deployment
- SOC-2 compliance (in-progress) (ETA Q3 2022)
- micro cost optimizations everywhere (which add up)
- built-in fault tolerance
- enabled collaboration for teams and enterprises

Contact our sales support engineering team so we can help you set up Grid with your own cloud credentials.
