Checkpointing (intermediate)
############################
**Audience:** Users looking to customize the checkpointing behavior

----

*****************************
Modify checkpointing behavior
*****************************
For fine-grain control over checkpointing behavior, use the :class:`~pytorch_lightning.callbacks.ModelCheckpoint` object

.. code-block:: python

        from pytorch_lightning.callbacks import ModelCheckpoint

        checkpoint_callback = ModelCheckpoint(dirpath="my/path/", save_top_k=2, monitor="val_loss")
        trainer = Trainer(callbacks=[checkpoint_callback])
        trainer.fit(model)
        checkpoint_callback.best_model_path

Any value that has been logged via *self.log* in the LightningModule can be monitored.

.. code-block:: python

        class LitModel(pl.LightningModule):
            def training_step(self, batch, batch_idx):
                self.log("my_metric", x)


        # 'my_metric' is now able to be monitored
        checkpoint_callback = ModelCheckpoint(monitor="my_metric")

----

*****************************
Save checkpoints by condition
*****************************
To save checkpoints based on a (*when/which/what/where*) condition (for example *when* the validation_loss is lower) modify the :class:`~pytorch_lightning.callbacks.ModelCheckpoint` properties.

When
====

- When using iterative training which doesn't have an epoch, you can checkpoint at every ``N`` training steps by specifying ``every_n_training_steps=N``.
- You can also control the interval of epochs between checkpoints using ``every_n_epochs`` between checkpoints, to avoid slowdowns.
- You can checkpoint at a regular time interval using ``train_time_interval`` argument independent of the steps or epochs.
- In case you are monitoring a training metrics, we'd suggest using ``save_on_train_epoch_end=True`` to ensure the required metric is being accumulated correctly for creating a checkpoint.


Which
=====

- You can save the last checkpoint when training ends using ``save_last`` argument.
- You can save top-K and last-K checkpoints by configuring the ``monitor`` and ``save_top_k`` argument.

    .. testcode::

        from pytorch_lightning.callbacks import ModelCheckpoint


        # saves top-K checkpoints based on "val_loss" metric
        checkpoint_callback = ModelCheckpoint(
            save_top_k=10,
            monitor="val_loss",
            mode="min",
            dirpath="my/path/",
            filename="sample-mnist-{epoch:02d}-{val_loss:.2f}",
        )

        # saves last-K checkpoints based on "global_step" metric
        # make sure you log it inside your LightningModule
        checkpoint_callback = ModelCheckpoint(
            save_top_k=10,
            monitor="global_step",
            mode="max",
            dirpath="my/path/",
            filename="sample-mnist-{epoch:02d}-{global_step}",
        )

-  You can customize the checkpointing behavior to monitor any quantity of your training or validation steps. For example, if you want to update your checkpoints based on your validation loss:

|

    .. testcode::

        from pytorch_lightning.callbacks import ModelCheckpoint


        class LitAutoEncoder(LightningModule):
            def validation_step(self, batch, batch_idx):
                x, y = batch
                y_hat = self.backbone(x)

                # 1. calculate loss
                loss = F.cross_entropy(y_hat, y)

                # 2. log val_loss
                self.log("val_loss", loss)


        # 3. Init ModelCheckpoint callback, monitoring "val_loss"
        checkpoint_callback = ModelCheckpoint(monitor="val_loss")

        # 4. Add your callback to the callbacks list
        trainer = Trainer(callbacks=[checkpoint_callback])


What
====

- By default, the ``ModelCheckpoint`` callback saves model weights, optimizer states, etc., but in case you have limited disk space or just need the model weights to be saved you can specify ``save_weights_only=True``.


Where
=====

- It gives you the ability to specify the ``dirpath`` and ``filename`` for your checkpoints. Filename can also be dynamic so you can inject the metrics that are being logged using :meth:`~pytorch_lightning.core.lightning.LightningModule.log`.

|

    .. testcode::

        from pytorch_lightning.callbacks import ModelCheckpoint


        # saves a file like: my/path/sample-mnist-epoch=02-val_loss=0.32.ckpt
        checkpoint_callback = ModelCheckpoint(
            dirpath="my/path/",
            filename="sample-mnist-{epoch:02d}-{val_loss:.2f}",
        )

|

The :class:`~pytorch_lightning.callbacks.ModelCheckpoint` callback is very robust and should cover 99% of the use-cases. If you find a use-case that is not configured yet, feel free to open an issue with a feature request on GitHub
and the Lightning Team will be happy to integrate/help integrate it.

*************************
Save checkpoints manually
*************************

You can manually save checkpoints and restore your model from the checkpointed state using :meth:`~pytorch_lightning.trainer.trainer.Trainer.save_checkpoint`
and :meth:`~pytorch_lightning.core.saving.ModelIO.load_from_checkpoint`.

.. code-block:: python

    model = MyLightningModule(hparams)
    trainer.fit(model)
    trainer.save_checkpoint("example.ckpt")

    # load the checkpoint later as normal
    new_model = MyLightningModule.load_from_checkpoint(checkpoint_path="example.ckpt")

Manual saving with distributed training
=======================================
In distributed training cases where a model is running across many machines, Lightning ensures that only one checkpoint is saved instead of a model per machine. This requires no code changes as seen below:

.. code-block:: python

    trainer = Trainer(strategy="ddp")
    model = MyLightningModule(hparams)
    trainer.fit(model)
    # Saves only on the main process
    trainer.save_checkpoint("example.ckpt")

Not using :meth:`~pytorch_lightning.trainer.trainer.Trainer.save_checkpoint` can lead to unexpected behavior and potential deadlock. Using other saving functions will result in all devices attempting to save the checkpoint. As a result, we highly recommend using the Trainer's save functionality.
If using custom saving functions cannot be avoided, we recommend using the :func:`~pytorch_lightning.utilities.rank_zero.rank_zero_only` decorator to ensure saving occurs only on the main process. Note that this will only work if all ranks hold the exact same state and won't work when using
model parallel distributed strategies such as deepspeed or sharded training.
