  In this tutorial, we will take a closer look at (popular) activation functions and investigate their effect on optimization properties in neural networks.
  Activation functions are a crucial part of deep learning models as they add the non-linearity to neural networks.
  There is a great variety of activation functions in the literature, and some are more beneficial than others.
  The goal of this tutorial is to show the importance of choosing a good activation function (and how to do so), and what problems might occur if we don't.
  This notebook is part of a lecture series on Deep Learning at the University of Amsterdam.
